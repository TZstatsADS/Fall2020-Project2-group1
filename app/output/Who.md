## <b>Who can benefit?<b>

#### <b>Individuals:</b> We hope that this app can help locals and travelers alike in making informed decisons in how they choose to spend their time in here in New York City. They are able to select hospitals, hotels, and restuarants based on a zip code of their choice.            

#### <b>Local Healthcare Providers:</b> Since our app contains recent cases of COVID-19, local clinics and hospitals can use this information to make predictions about future cases in their areas.
            
#### <b>Local Newspapers:</b> We also believe that local papers can help keep the public more informed about <i>recent and local cases so that those living in severely affected neighborhoods know to take proper precautions.
            
#### <b>Local Businesses:</b> Local shops can get a better sense of how COVID-19 is spreading throughout their area so they can change store hours and inventory as needed. Mobile store and restaurants, such as food trucks, can also use this app to move and set up shop accordingly.
