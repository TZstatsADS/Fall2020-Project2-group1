### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

The covid_zip_code.RData file is pre-processed data from the gloabl.R file. It combines data from the NYCHealth Open Data (data-by-modzcta.csv and recent-4-week-by-modzcta.csv) and well as zip code shape data from the 'tigris' package.
