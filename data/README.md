### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The coronavirus-data-master folder, provided by NYCHealth Open Data was used for the Maps and Averages tabs. Main files used where data-by-modzcta.csv and recent-4-week-by-modzcta.csv. Please see the subfolders for a more detail description of these files.
