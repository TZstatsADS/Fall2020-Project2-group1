Project 2

Team members: Zhenglei Chen, Levi Lee, Xinyuan Peng (Presenter), Yuwei Tong, Tianle Zhu

Summary: In this project, we created an R Shiny app that allowed users (individuals, healthcare providers, newspapers, and businesses) to learn and understand the numbers behind COVID-19 in New York City. 

[Contribution Statement] 

Everyone had a hand in creating the NYC COVID-19 map in the Maps tab. 

Levi added the interactive features (i.e. zip code dropdown menu, legend information ratio buttons, and recent data filter checkbox) and created the tables of averages on the Averages tab. He also established the main framework for the app using the default as a baseline.
